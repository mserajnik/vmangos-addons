> Various addons for playing on VMaNGOS servers

This repository contains various addons I use when playing on my private
[VMaNGOS][vmangos] server. The main purpose is to provide an easy way to keep
track of, install and update the addons (via Git).

The addons come from different (publicly accessible) sources which I have
linked to in the overview below. However, I could not find license files that
specifically allow publishing the source code for all of them, therefore: if
you are the author of one (or more) of the addons and do not want the code
included in this repository, simply contact me.
